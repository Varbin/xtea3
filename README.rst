============
Python XTEA3
============

As the package xtea_ is now compatible with both major Python versions, 2 and 3,
two different package versions are not required anymore.

All non utility members of the `xtea3` namespace will remain in place,
but are internally used from the xtea_ package instead,
which will be automatically installed with this updated version.
